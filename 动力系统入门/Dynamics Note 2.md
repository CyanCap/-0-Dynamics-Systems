# Section Map

Something weird, difficult definition and idea.

The construction of a *Poincare (first-return) map*.
Point $x\in M$ such that tangent vector $\xi(x)\neq 0$ and an $(m-1)$-dimensional submanifold $N$ containing $x$ and transversal to the vector field.
The latter one means that for every point $y\in N$ the vector $\xi(y)$ is not tangent to $N$. Remember $\xi(y)$ is tangent vector for $M$.

If $x$ is periodic for the flow, that means $\varphi^{t_0}(x) = x$ for some positive $t$, then every nearby orbit of the flow intersects $N$ at a time close to $t_0$ so define a map $F_N:U\rightarrow N$
$$
F_N(x)=x.
$$
$U$ is the neighborhood of $x$ on $N$.
This map is *section map* or *first-return map*.
